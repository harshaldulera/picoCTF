From inspecting the source code of the page and assets I got some parts of the flag.

<figure><img src="./html.png"></figure>

The css file had the second part of the flag.

<figure><img src="./css.png"></figure>

The js file said this so they're talking about `robots.txt`.

It had the third part of the flag and hint.

<figure><img src="./robots.png"></figure>

I assume they are talking about `.htaccess` since it's an apache server.

Since they're building on Mac, It add's the `DS_Store` file to all of the folders.
